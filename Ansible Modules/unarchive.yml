# 9. unarchive

# Use the unarchive module to extract the contents of archive files such as tar or zip files. 
# By default, it copies the archive file from the control node to the target machine before extracting it.
# Change this behavior by providing the parameter remote_src: yes.

# For example, extract the contents of a .tar.gz file that has already been downloaded to the target host
# with this syntax:

- name: Extract contents of app.tar.gz
  unarchive:
    src: /tmp/app.tar.gz
    dest: /app
    remote_src: yes

# Some archive technologies require additional packages to be available on the target system; 
# for example, the package unzip to extract .zip files.

# Depending on the archive format used, this module may or may not work idempotently. 
# To prevent unnecessary changes, you can use the parameter creates to specify a file or directory
# that this module would create when extracting the archive contents.
# If this file or directory already exists, the module does not extract the contents again.
