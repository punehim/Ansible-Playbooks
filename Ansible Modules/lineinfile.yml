# 8. lineinfile

# The lineinfile module allows you to manage single lines on existing files.
# It's useful to update targeted configuration on existing files without changing 
# the rest of the file or copying the entire configuration file.

# For example, add a new entry to your hosts file like this:

- name: Ensure host rh8-vm03 in hosts file
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    line: 192.168.122.236 rh8-vm03
    state: present

 # You can also use this module to change an existing line by applying the parameter regexp to look 
 # for an existing line to replace. For example, update the sshd_config file to prevent root login by
 # modifying the line PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no:

 - name: Ensure root cannot login via ssh
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
    line: PermitRootLogin no
    state: present

 # Note: Use the service module to restart the SSHD service to enable this change.

#This module is also idempotent, but, in case of line modification,
# ensure the regular expression matches both the original and updated states to avoid unnecessary changes
