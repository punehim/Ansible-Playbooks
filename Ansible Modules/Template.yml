# 2. template
# The template module works similarly to the copy module, but it processes content dynamically 
# using the Jinja2 templating language before copying it to the target hosts.

# For example, define a "message of the day" template that displays the target system name, like this:

- name: Ensure MOTD file is in place
  template:
    src: templates/motd.j2
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644

 # Before copying the file, Ansible processes the template and interpolates the variable, 
 # replacing it with the target host system name. For example, 
 # if the target system name is rh8-vm03, the result file is:

# Welcome to rh8-vm03.

# While the copy module can also interpolate variables when using the content parameter, 
# the template module allows additional flexibility by creating template files, 
# which enable you to define more complex content, including for loops, if conditions, 
# and more. For a complete reference, check Jinja2 documentation.

# This module is also idempotent, and it will not copy the file 
# if the content on the target system already matches the template's content.
