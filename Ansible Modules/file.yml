# 7. file

# The file module allows you to control the state of files and directoriesâ€”setting permissions, ownership,
#  and SELinux labels.

# For instance, use the file module to create a directory /app owned by the user ricardo, 
# with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and the group users:

- name: Ensure directory /app exists
  file:
    path: /app
    state: directory
    owner: ricardo
    group: users
    mode: 0770


# You can also use this module to set file properties on directories recursively by using the parameter 
# recurse: yes or delete files and directories with the parameter state: absent.

# This module works with idempotency for most of its parameters, 
# but some of them may make it change the target path every time. 
# Check the documentation for more details.
