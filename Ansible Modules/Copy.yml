# 1. copy
#The copy module allows you to copy a file from the Ansible control node to the target hosts. 
#In addition to copying the file, it allows you to set ownership, permissions, and SELinux labels to 
#the destination file. Here's an example of using the copy module to copy a "message of the day" 
#configuration file to the target hosts:

- name: Ensure MOTD file is in place
  copy:
    src: files/motd
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644

 # For less complex content, you can copy the content directly to the destination 
 # file without having a local file, like this:   


 - name: Ensure MOTD file is in place
  copy:
    content: "Welcome to this system."
    dest: /etc/motd
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644

# This module works idempotently, which means it will only copy the file if the same file is not already
# in place with the same content and permissions.

# The copy module is a great option to copy a small number of files with static content. 
# If you need to copy a large number of files, take a look at the synchronize module. 
# To copy files with dynamic content, take a look at the template module next.
