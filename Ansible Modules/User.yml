# 3. user

# The user module allows you to create and manage Linux users in your target system.
# This module has many different parameters, 
# but in its most basic form, you can use it to create a new user.

# For example, to create the user ricardo with UID  2001, 
# part of the groups users and wheel, and password mypassword, apply the user module with these parameters:

- name: Ensure user ricardo exists
  user:
    name: ricardo
    group: users
    groups: wheel
    uid: 2001
    password: "{{ 'mypassword' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
    state: present


# Notice that this module tries to be idempotent, 
#but it cannot guarantee that for all its options. For instance, 
#if you execute the previous module example again, 
#it will reset the password to the defined value, changing the user in the system for every execution. 
#To make this example idempotent, use the parameter update_password: on_create, 
#ensuring Ansible only sets the password when creating the user and not on subsequent runs.

#You can also use this module to delete a user by setting the parameter state: absent.

#The user module has many options for you to manage multiple user aspects.
# Make sure you take a look at the module documentation for more information.
