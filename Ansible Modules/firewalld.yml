# 6. firewalld

# Use the firewalld module to control the system firewall with the firewalld daemon on systems 
#that support it, such as Red Hat-based distributions.

# For example, to open the HTTP service on port 80, use it like this:

- name: Ensure port 80 (http) is open
  firewalld:
    service: http
    state: enabled
    permanent: yes
    immediate: yes


 # You can also specify custom ports instead of service names with the port parameter. 
 # In this case, make sure to specify the protocol as well. 
 # For example, to open TCP port 3000, use this

 - name: Ensure port 3000/TCP is open
  firewalld:
    port: 3000/tcp
    state: enabled
    permanent: yes
    immediate: yes

    # You can also use this module to control other firewalld aspects like zones or complex rules. 
    #Make sure to check the module's documentation for a comprehensive list of options.
